# Is it daylight saving time?

Built on AstroJS, a simple static(?) site to check if it's daylight saving time in your area.

## Why? 

I would always wonder in my timezone if we were in the daylight saving part of the year or the other.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
